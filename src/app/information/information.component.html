        <p>Wondering what to do with your leftover ingredients? Just type any dish or ingredient keyword in the search bar and RecipeBase will find 10 recipes with an ingredient list! No need to scram around the web, scroll down those long blog posts just to find what ingredients you can use. Lessen the number of annoying pop-ups for cookies or e-mail lists just to find that ONE recipe you want to make this evening. Discover with ease! Look around and once you feel like you found something interesting, just click on the recipe link and get taken to the official recipe page.

        The idea came from me trying to cook more and more. Every time I search for a recipe online I have to scroll through the life stories of bloggers. Some people truly enjoy the whole history and honestly, I have huge respect for that. But for people who just want to find a new recipe and fast, here you have it -- a website to ease your search adventure pain.
        <br />
        <br />
        I hope the website saves time for you just like it does for me. Take care and have a nice meal!
